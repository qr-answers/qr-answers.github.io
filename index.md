QR-Answers and QR-Contest are applications that allow you to publish a question where the answers are marked with QR codes.
The voter only has to scan the code and nothing further.  No surveys to take, no filling out forms.  Just point your phone's camera
at the QR code answer you want to vote for and press the link displayed. Done.
