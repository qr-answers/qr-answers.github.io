## Question and Answers
  Selecting this section will display the list of Questions that you have created.  When you go to this screen, the first accordion (section) to open up is this one.  To add a new Question, you click on the plus sign <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-square-plus"></i></span> Add Question.  An empty text box will appear where you enter the Question. You may add multiple Questions per contest *prior* to paying for and launching your contest. See the NOTE below.

{: .note }
> If the plus sign Add Question does not appear (like in the top picture above), it is because you have already purchased this Contest and Question.  If this is the case, a small help icon will appear to the right of the paid for question reminding you that you cannot add or change this quesiton.  You may not add new Questions to an already launched contest.  However, it is possible to add new Answers to an already paid for Question.  Click the question and you will see the paid for answers with a lock next to them, but the plus sign <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-square-plus"></i></span> Add Answer will be available.  You may add the new Answers and then go to the Pay and Launch accordion to pay for them. To add a new Question, create a new contest and add the question there.
