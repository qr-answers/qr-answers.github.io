<div class="accordion-bar">Questions and Answers</div>
## Question and Answers
  Selecting this section will display the list of Questions that you have created.  When you go to this screen, the first accordion (section) to open up is this one.  To add a new Question, you click on the plus sign Add Question.  An empty text box will appear where you enter the Question. You may add multiple Questions per contest *prior* to paying for and launching your contest. See the NOTE below.

   <img class="image-border" alt="add question, enter value" src="../../../assets/images/add_question2.png">

{: .note }
> If the plus sign Add Question does not appear (like in the top picture above), it is because you have already purchased this Contest and Question.  If this is the case, a small help icon will appear to the right of the paid for question reminding you that you cannot add or change this quesiton.  You may not add new Questions to an already launched contest.  However, it is possible to add new Answers to an already paid for Question.  Click the question and you will see the paid for answers with a lock next to them, but the plus sign Add Answer will be available.  You may add the new Answers and then go to the Pay and Launch accordion to pay for them. To add a new Question, create a new contest and add the question there.

<div class="accordion-bar">Configure Options</div>
## Configure Options
  This section allows you to choose many different options for your contest - from frequency of voting to how to display the output PDF or PNG files.  We'll look at each section by section.  Be sure to press the <span class="inline-button">Update</span> button at the bottom to save your changes.

### General Options
<img class="image-border" alt="contest general options" src="../../../assets/images/contest_genopt.png">

  <span class="form-label">Limit Responses (per user)</span> - This determines how many times a voter (someone who scans the QR code) can vote.  The default is **Once**.  This will allow a person to have just one vote that counts.  They can change votes by scanning another one, but that will cancel their first vote.  You may also choose:

Hourly - can vote one time per hour

Daily - can vote one time per day

Once - (default) can vote one time only

No Limit - can vote as many times as they want

  <span class="form-label">Question Page Header (2 lines maximum)</span> - This text will appear at the top of the generated PDF file.  It will not show on a PNG image if you choose that output option later. The text should help the voter understand what they are supposed to do.  The default of *Use your phone's camera to vote. Scan, Click, Done.* is an example. You may put anything you like there - but it has a maximum of  2 lines.


<img class="image-border" alt="page header" src="../../../assets/images/page_header.png">

### Question Page Appearance
<img class="image-border" alt="question page appearance" src="../../../assets/images/contest_qpageappear.png">

<span class="form-label">1. QR Code</span> - You may choose the internal Code Shape and foreground and background colors of the QR code that is generated for your answers.  The default internal Code Shape is a square, but there are many options.  Press the left <span class="inline-icon-black"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-left"></i></span> and right <span class="inline-icon-black"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i></span> arrow buttons to choose your code. You should be sure to try your choice out at the size you print so you can verify the code will scan.  You can choose the colors of the QR code by clicking on the foreground (left box) and background (right box) color boxes.

<img class="image-border" alt="QR code foreground color" src="../../../assets/images/contest_qrfg.png">

<span class="form-label">Logo</span> - Optionally, you may add a logo that gets printed on the lower left of the generated PDF - it will not show up if you choose PNG output.  You may <span class="inline-button">Upload</span> an image from your device, or you can <span class="inline-button">Take Photo</span> if your device supports it.

{: .note }
> Make sure if you alter any values in this section, you need to scroll down and press the <span class="inline-button">Update</span> button.

<span class="form-label">2. Default QR Layout for Text Answers</span> - Currently, there is no choice here. If your answers are text-only (vs photo or photo + text), then they will print with the QR code above the text of the answer.

<span class="form-label">3. Default QR Layout for Photo Answers </span> - The images show the layout of the QR code (shown in color) vs. the image (shown in grey).  For example, the first one shows the QR code in the upper left (default) and the image behind and to the right of it.  You may choose the position of the QR code by selecting one of the 6 choices.  The below image shows how this is printed when you have image answers with answer text in a PDF.

<img class="image-border" alt="QR code in the upper left with image on the lower right" src="../../../assets/images/qr_upperleft.png">

<span class="form-label">4. Fit and Opacity for Photo Answers </span> - You may choose how photos are scaled into the viewable area by selecting <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i></span> Cover or <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i></span> Contain.  Cover means that the photo will comletely fill the static rectangle area of the destination (like the image above).  Contain will scale the photo proportionately keeping its aspect ratio into the destination rectangle - so that you see the whole photo (below).

<img class="image-border" alt="photo fully visible with contain setting" src="../../../assets/images/contain.png">

*Opacity* can be controlled by moving the slider left or right.  By default, the photo will completely overwrite whatever is under it.  For example, on PNG files, it is possible to make the background of the screen a color (say blue) and then change the opacity of the photo so that the background 'bleeds through' the photo.  You can play with this to see the effects it has in the varying output formats.

### QR Scan Response Chart Style
<img class="image-border" alt="response chart style" src="../../../assets/images/response_chartstyle.png">

<span class="form-label">Select chart style</span> - After the user scans an answer, they are redirected to a page that will show them a "Thank You" page, a pie chart or a gradient chart.  The "Thank You" page will not display any results. Both of the other chart types will display the results of prior votes and the current user's vote.  You may pick which type of page is displayed here (pie or gradient).


<div class="accordion-bar">Print/Download</div>
## Print/Download
This section allows you to choose whether to output PDF(s) for your Question(s) and Answers or to output PNG files (individual images per file).  You are allowed to print your contest so that you may test the voting.  Until you launch your contest by paying for it, the results will only show the last vote scanned.  So, if you have a quesiton with 3 answers and you print a PDF out, you can test your campaign by scanning them one at a time and seeing the results.  Each time you scan (no matter who scan), the prior result will be removed.  You can think of this as a 'draft' mode where you are just testing your contest, but not really aggregating results.  After testing and your're ready to launch/publish your contest, go to [Pay and Launch](#pay-and-launch)

<img class="image-border" alt="print and download options" src="../../../assets/images/print_download.png">

### PDF
<span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i></span> PDF - this will output one PDF per Question.  The Answers will be arranged automatically on the page.  You should not put more than 6 answers on a Question if you want them to layout correctly on a single PDF.  You may choose Lanscape (the default) or Portrait orientation for the PDF.

The other settings are explained in the <span class="inline-accordion">Configure Options</span> section above.  Setting them here will override the <span class="inline-accordion">Configure Options</span> values.

{: .note }
> If you have Adobe Acrobat or the new free Microsoft Edge PDF Editor, you may edit the generated PDF and place things wherever you like.  Just be sure to not modify the QR codes in the document.

### Automatic PNG
<span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i></span> Automatic PNG - selecting this will bring up the below interface.  The layout engine tries to figure out the best way to layout your PNG files based on some internal algorithm.  If you don't like the way it turns out, you can manually layout your PNG files by choosing <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i></span> Manual PNG.

<img class="image-border" alt="automatic PNG generation" src="../../../assets/images/automatic_png.png">

You may choose the resulting size of the PNG files by changing the Size (width x height). Or, you may choose a pre-defined size (like for your Canon Ivy Printer, so you can print stickers!).  We update this list often.  You may also change the QR Code colors, Text style and photo transparency (if you have photo answers).

Click on an object in the preview to set the properties.  For example, the QR code is selected by default when you first get to this screen.  You can change the foreground and background colors of the QR code as well as the shape of the little internal 'rectangles'.  

#### QR Code
To change the colors, click on the left color box for foreground or the right color box for background.  Then, select a color from the color picker.  You'll see the preview update with your changes. To make the color picker go away, click outside of it.

<img class="image-border" alt="QR code color picker" src="../../../assets/images/qr_color_picker.png">

To change the shape of the internal 'rectangles', use the left <span class="inline-icon-black"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-left"></i></span> and right <span class="inline-icon-black"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i></span>arrow buttons.

<img class="image-border" alt="QR code internal shapes" src="../../../assets/images/qr_shape_picker.png">

#### Text
Click on the **Text Here** at the top of the preview.  That will display a row of attributes you can change for the text.  You may change the font color, bold, underline and italic.

<img class="image-border" alt="text attributes, color, bold, underline, italic" src="../../../assets/images/text_attributes.png">

#### Photo
Click on the picture of the flowers and you may change the opacity of the image.  The default is 100 - meaning completely opaque so nothing under the photo shows through.  You can change the opacity so that the image background (see below) shows through or blends with the photo. The below sample shows the opacity at 50% on a white background, so it make the photo 'lighter'.

<img class="image-border" alt="photo attributes" src="../../../assets/images/photo_attributes.png">

#### Background
Click on the empty space of the background and you may change the color.  The default is white, so the color box above the preview is a little tricky to see.  We've changed it to light yellow below:

<img class="image-border" alt="light yellow background" src="../../../assets/images/light_yellow_bg.png">

#### Hot Tip
In the above image, you can see that the background of the QR code is white.  We'll change the background of the QR code to light blue with a 50% transparency (in the color picker).  See below.  The QR code background becomes light green because the light blue combined with the yellow of the overall Background will give you light green (blue + yellow = green).

<img class="image-border" alt="light blue QR background plus light yellow image background gives light green QR background" src="../../../assets/images/qr_blend.png">

#### Make PNGs
When you are finished altering the properties, click <span class="inline-button">Make PNGs</span> to generate your PNG files.  You will get a message saying "Generating document(s)...", then a short animation with a message that says "Open your document(s) here:".  See below:

<img class="image-border" alt="open your docuemnts" src="../../../assets/images/auto_png_download.png">

You have 3 options here:
1. Clicking the far left icon <img height="1em" src="../../../assets/images/view_in_browser.png"> will open the PNG files in a new tab in your browser and show you them in a list.  This can be helpful if you want to individually print them or just access them without unzipping them.
2. Clicking the underlined text in the middle (a link to the .zip file) will download the resulting .zip file to your device. 
3. Clicking the far right icon <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-regular fa-copy"></i></span> will copy the URL for the .zip file to your copy/paste buffer.


{: .note }
> If you get a message saying "No questions picked for this location" - you need to go back to the <span class="inline-accordion">Questions and Answers</span> section and make sure you have both at least one Question and at least one Answer per question.

{: .note }
> To show the Print/Download options again, close, then open the <span class="inline-accordion">Print/Download</span> accordion.

### PNG Zip Files
The .zip files generated when you create PNG images instead of PDF contains several files.
* **directory.json** - this file is a directory listing of all questions and answers in the .zip file.  The json file (a file for a programmer) contains information about each question and answer - including the file names corresponding to each Question and Answer.  If you open it in a text editor, it is readable.  Here is an example of the PNG files generated from our Chicken example:
```
{
  "location": "QR-vote location",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q_0",
      "question": "Which chicken do you like better?",
      "answers": [
        {
          "id": "q_0_a_0",
          "text": "Lady Feathers",
          "image": "q_0_a_0.png",
          "size": {
            "width": 1024,
            "height": 1024
          }
        },
        {
          "id": "q_0_a_1",
          "text": "Yellow Fella",
          "image": "q_0_a_1.png",
          "size": {
            "width": 1024,
            "height": 1024
          }
        },
        {
          "id": "q_0_a_2",
          "text": "Joker",
          "image": "q_0_a_2.png",
          "size": {
            "width": 1024,
            "height": 1024
          }
        }
      ],
      "image": "q_0.png"
    }
  ]
}
```
For QR-Contest, the "location" will always show up as "QR-vote location" (this has more meaning in QR-Answers).  The Questions each have an index (the order they were entered in the <span class="inline-accordion">Questions and Answers</span> section).  Each Answer also has an index.  Both of these indeces start at 0 (sorry, a computer thing...).  A Question is noted by the letter "q"; an Answers is noted by the letter "a".  Given the file names would be crazy long if we used the text of the question and answers, we thought it better to use numbers.  So, if you want to find out what the 3rd answer in your first question looks like, you come up with it like this:  Start with "q" (Question), then the index (0 since the first one starts at 0, not 1), add "a" for Answer, then the answer index, which for the 3rd one is 2; then put underscores (_) between each item.  So, the file name of the first Question's 3rd answer is:  "q_0_a_2.png".  We also print out the Question text - the file name is constructed the same way:  q_0.png  is the first Question.  The json file also has the size of each image.  

{: .note }
> You can read up on json (why would you?), but a quick summary is this:  each 'object' starts and ends with matched curly brackets { }; each array (list) starts and ends with square brackets [ ].

* Question files (see above), for example **q_0.png**
* The Answer files for each question, for example  **q_0_a_0.png** is the first answer to the first question

### Manual PNG
<span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i></span> Manual PNG - Selecting this option will allow you to control every visual aspect of each of your questions and answers. 

<img class="image-border" alt="manually layout PNG images" src="../../../assets/images/manual_png.png">

See [Auto PNG](#automatic-png) above to see how to change [QR Code colors](#qr-code), [Text attributes](#text), [Photo attributes](#photo), and the [Background](#background).  You may change these for **every** Answer, or you can modify the 1st Answer to be the layout you would like to use for all of the Answers and choose <span class="inline-button">Apply current layout to all</span>.  In addition, if you are on an Answer past the first one, you can use the <span class="inline-button">Match Previous</span> button to match the layout of the Answer you are on to the previous Answer.

The Manual PNG layout also allows you to modify the Photo to be Contain or Cover.  See the section [Question Page Appearance](#question-page-appearance) for a description.  Click on the Photo and above the Opacity setting will be a checkbox.  The default setting is the aspect correct the image and size the containing box around it so that if you resize the box, the image will aspect fill the box.  However, if you uncheck the box, you will have two choices.  The left is Cover and the right is Contain.  You may play with these to see what they do.

<img class="image-border" alt="aspect correct or contain or cover" src="../../../assets/images/manpng_contcover.png">

In addition to colors, fonts, etc. you may also manually locate any of the object in the preview area.  Select an object (text, QR code, photo) and you will see gripper handles on the 4 corners of the object (the image above has them around the QR code).  You may change the size of the object by dragging the gripper handles, or you may click and drag the middle of the object to relocate it.  The stacking order of the objects is: QR Code on top, then the Text answer (if any), then the Photo (if any), then the background.

{: .note }
> Changing the size of the Text box will increase or decrease the font size to fit your Answer into the box.

You may traverse through the Question(s) and Answers using the left <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-left"></i></span> and right <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i></span> arrows.

When you are done laying out the PNG files, you should press <span class="inline-button">Make PNGs</span>.  The PNG files will be generated [see here](#make-pngs).  If you do not traverse through all the questions or answers, the ones you have not visited will use the auto-layout algorithm.


<div class="accordion-bar">Pay and Launch</div>
## Pay and Launch
This section is used to actually pay for and launch your Contest.  Until you purchase your Question(s) and Answers here, your contest will be in 'draft' or 'test' mode.  Every scan of your answers will 'overwrite' the last scan's vote.  So, you can scan each answer and every time the results show, they will only show one result.  To get all votes to count, you need to purchase your Question here.  

This is also the place to come back to if you want to add more Answers (for example, you launch a chili cookoff and someone comes in with a late entry after you purchased the Question).  If your contest is very successful and you only purchased a small number of responses, you can add more responses here.  In addition, if you go over your response limit, there is an option to acquire your overage responses here.  In short, you should check back here every so often to see if you need to purchase any new responses, etc.  If you have selected to receive notifications from the Home page menu - Edit Profile - you will receive an email if your responses are getting close to the limit. Come back here to add more responses if you want to see them.

### Purchase Question and Answers
* The first thing you need to do is purchase your Question and Answers.  This section will show you how many Questions you have with how many Answers.  You need to select the plan option you would like to purchase from the dropdown(s).  For our example, we have a Question with 3 Answers.  We think we'll be super successful, so we choose the option with 15,000 responses and 3 months to receive them.  We're posting this Contest on a big Daktronics display at a rodeo!

<img class="image-border" alt="prior purchase of one question with three answers" src="../../../assets/images/pl_purchase0.png">

### Sripe Checkout
* Be sure to check the Purchase option in the dropdown and then click <span class="inline-button">Checkout</span>.  You will be redirected to a Stripe checkout page that will display the total you owe.  Fill in your credit card information and then click <span class="inline-button">Pay Now</span>.  If you don't want to purchase at this time, hit the back arrow in the upper left by the word Payment.

<img class="image-border" alt="Stripe checkout screen" src="../../../assets/images/pl_stripe.png">

### Purchase Confirmation
* After the purchase is confirmed, the interface will redirect to the Home page and show you the most recent purchase you just completed.  

<img class="image-border" alt="Home page billing trnsaction section" src="../../../assets/images/home_billing.png">

This will only show up on the Home page right after your purchase is complete.  We use Stripe to process payments.  If you want to see your overall payment history, you can go to the Home tab, select the Menu in the upper right corner, then Edit Plan, then choose the Billing accordion.  This will show a complete history of your purchases.  

### Contest Purchase History
If you would like to see only the purchase related to a particular contest, go to the Contests, click on the contest you are interested in, then click on the <span class="inline-accordion">Pay and Launch</span> accordion.  The purchase history and options to purchase other items will show up there. Here is an example of a single Question being purchased that has 3 answers.  All 3 answers have been paid for.  

<img class="image-border" alt="after purchase of one question with three answers" src="../../../assets/images/pl_purchase1.png">

### Purchasing Additional Answers
If you had a late chili entry like the example above, you might see (4 answers, 3 purchased) and the dropdown would recommend you paying for the 4th answer, otherwise it would not be counted in the voting. See below:

<img class="image-border" alt="billing pay for added answer" src="../../../assets/images/bill_add_answer.png">
