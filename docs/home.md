<div class="accordion-bar">Viewing Mode</div>
Viewing Mode is used from a mobile device to allow you to test your contest without registering any votes.  
The default is for your device to record votes after you scan a QR code.  To test your QR codes, you may select
VIEW RESULTS to see how many votes have been cast, but your scan will not register as a vote.

  <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i></span>Set QR Scan Mode to VIEW RESULTS from this device - responses will not be recorded.
