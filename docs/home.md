## Presence Indicator
Throughout the application, you may see a circle with a letter or number in it in different places.  This is the presence indicator that someone else is working on the same page or item that you are.  For example, the below shows a single letter G on the home page - which means I am the only one in my team working on this page.

  <p align="center" class="screen-shot">
  <img class="image-border" alt="presence indicator of one person" src="../../assets/images/home_presence.png">
  </p>

The below shows there are 2 people working on this page.  If you click on the little grey dot below and to the left of the circled number, it will show you a list of other peoples' user names who are also on this page from your team.  In the future, there may be actions (like messaging) you can access from the list.

  <p align="center" class="screen-shot">
  <img class="image-border" alt="presence indicator of two people" src="../../assets/images/home_presence2.png">
  </p>

These indicators will show up at the page level as well as the item edit level.  For example, if you are editing a question and someone else is editing the same question, you will see the presence indicator show up on that edit item.

> Keep in mind this is a collaborative application - as changes are made by other team members, they are displayed on your screen in real-time (much like Google Docs or Figma).

## Recent Results
<div class="accordion-bar">Recent Results</div>
  Selecting this section will allow you to see the latest results from your Project(s).  If nothing is shown, then there are no recent
  results to display.  Results are shown in graphical format (pie chart, bar chart, etc.).  

  <p align="center" class="screen-shot">
  <img class="image-border" alt="Recent results" src="../../assets/images/recent_results.png">
  </p>

  You may go to the Results bottom tab to see all of your Project's results.

## Select Current Team
<div class="accordion-bar">Select Current Team</div>
You may select which team you are working on in this section.  If you created the account and it is the only qr-answers group you are part of, then you will see a single choice of "your name - owner".  If you are part of multiple teams (someone else invited you to be part of their team), you will see all teams you are part of listed here.  When you select a team, the interface will switch for you to access that team's Projects.  The owner of the team has control over what Projects and features you may access. See "Access Control" for a complete description of permissions.

## Viewing Mode
<div class="accordion-bar">Viewing Mode</div>
Viewing Mode is used from a mobile device to allow you to test your contest without registering any votes.  
The default is for your device to record votes after you scan a QR code.  To test your QR codes, you may select
VIEW RESULTS to see how many votes have been cast, but your scan will not register as a vote.

  <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle"></i></span>Set QR Scan Mode to RECORD votes from this device.<br/>
  <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i></span>Set QR Scan Mode to VIEW RESULTS from this device - responses will not be recorded.

## Billing Transaction
<div class="accordion-bar">Billing Transaction</div>
This section will only show up immediately after you have purchased something. See [Purchase Confirmation](./contests/pay_launch#purchase-confirmation) for details.  It will show a summary of the purchase here - but only directly after the purchase.  If you want to see a list of all purchases, click the menu icon <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-bars"></i></span> in the upper right and choose Edit Profile, then Billing.  All transactions will show up there.
