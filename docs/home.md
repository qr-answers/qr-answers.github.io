  Selecting this section will allow you to see the latest results from your contest(s).  If nothing is shown, then there are no recent
  results to display.  Results are shown in graphical format (pie chart, bar chart, etc.).  You may go to the Results bottom tab to 
  see all of your contest's results.

Viewing Mode is used from a mobile device to allow you to test your contest without registering any votes.  
The default is for your device to record votes after you scan a QR code.  To test your QR codes, you may select
VIEW RESULTS to see how many votes have been cast, but your scan will not register as a vote.
