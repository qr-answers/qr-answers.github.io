<div class="accordion-bar">Recent Results</div>
  Selecting this section will allow you to see the latest results from your contest(s).  If nothing is shown, then there are no recent
  results to display.  Results are shown in graphical format (pie chart, bar chart, etc.).  

  <img class="image-border" alt="Recent results" src="../../assets/images/recent_results.png">

  You may go to the Results bottom tab to see all of your contest's results.

<div class="accordion-bar">Viewing Mode</div>
Viewing Mode is used from a mobile device to allow you to test your contest without registering any votes.  
The default is for your device to record votes after you scan a QR code.  To test your QR codes, you may select
VIEW RESULTS to see how many votes have been cast, but your scan will not register as a vote.

  <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle"></i></span>Set QR Scan Mode to RECORD votes from this device.<br/>
  <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i></span>Set QR Scan Mode to VIEW RESULTS from this device - responses will not be recorded.

<div class="accordion-bar">Billing Transaction</div>
This section will only show up immediately after you have purchased something. See [Purchase Confirmation](./contests/pay_launch#purchase-confirmation) for details.  It will show a summary of the purchase here - but only directly after the purchase.  If you want to see a list of all purchases, click the menu icon <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-bars"></i></span> in the upper right and choose Edit Profile, then Billing.  All transactions will show up there.  If you want to see the billing items for a particular Contest, go to the Contest Detail page and scroll down to the [Pay and Launch](./contests/pay_launch#contest-purchase-history) section.
