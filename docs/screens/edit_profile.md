<div class="accordion-bar">Change Password</div>
Your username will show at the top.  You will need to enter your Current password as well as enter and verify your New password.


<div class="accordion-bar">Billing</div>
This section will show any billing transactions that you have had.  If there are no transactions (meaning you have not purchased a Question/Answers combination), a message will be displayed.

<div class="accordion-bar">Terminate Service</div>
There are 2 options for terminating your service.  You may Cancel the service - which will archive all of your data for up to 30 days (you may contact support@qr-contest.com to reinstate your account) or you may Delete your service - which will permanently delete all of your Contests, Questions, Answers and all Response data.  After making a choice, select the <span class="inline-button">Update</span> button.  It will prompt you to confirm your choice.
