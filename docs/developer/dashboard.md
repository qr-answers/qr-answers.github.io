## What is a Dashboard?

A Dashboard is URL that can be embedded in an iFrame or used directly in a browser to show real-time results from your Questions/Answers.  Each time someone scans an Answer, the interface will udpate in real-time.  So, if you sent out fliers asking people to vote for which new company logo to use, you could put an iFrame on your main web page and see the real-time votes display in that iFrame.  There are many different kinds of graph types and analytics that can be displayed.  Here is a sample Dashboard:



## Dashboard Web Interface

Go to https://dev.dashboards.qr-answers.com for the user interface.  You log in with the same credentials you would with app.qr-answers.com.   You must be marked as a Developer in the Team Management area of your Administrator's account.  If you are not the Administrator, contact your Administrator for them to add you as a Developer under Team Management.
