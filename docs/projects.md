The Projects tab is used to create or list your Projects.  This is the starting point for you to create your Projects.  For a good overview of the Project concept, read [this](../index#project-concept---important) from the Introduction.

   <p align="center" class="screen-shot">
   <img class="image-border" alt="Projects tab, add projects" src="../../assets/images/projects_tab.png">
   </p>

The default Project list display shows "Active" Projects.  You may toggle between "Active" and "Archived" Projects be selecting the filter <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-filter"></i></span> icon in the upper right.  See [Project Delete and Archive](#project-delete-and-archive) below.

## Add Project
You may choose the plus sign <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-square-plus"></i></span> Add Project to create a new Project.  After clicking the plus sign, you enter the Project name you would like
to use in the empty text box.  Press tab or return to save the Project name.  

{: .note }
> If for some reason you get a blank line without a text box, <br><img class="image-border" alt="Contest details screen" src="../../assets/images/projects_blankline.png"><br> you may long press on the 'blank' line and a text box will appear, enter your Project name.  <br> <img class="image-border" alt="Contest details screen" src="../../assets/images/proj_longp.png"><br>Alternatively, click on the blank line to go to the details page (shown below) and then click on the edit pencil icon in the upper right to type in the Project name.  This 'disappearing text box' issue may happen occassionally, we are working to fix this for all browsers.

Next, click on the Project name to take you to the details of the Project.  

## Project Details
The default display of the Project Details page is to open the <span class="inline-accordion">Campaigns</span> accordion.  After the basics of adding <span class="inline-accordion">Locations</span>, <span class="inline-accordion">Questions and Answers</span> is complete, most of the work is done in the Campaigns section.

   </p>

### Edit Project
As you can see above, the Project Details screen has an edit pencil <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i></span> icon in the upper right. Clicking on that will bring up the Edit Project screen.

   <p align="center" class="screen-shot">

   </p>

You may change the Project Name here.  You may also add an Abbreviation for the Project that will show up in the [Results](./results) overview.  In addition, you may add Tags to your Project.  In general Tags are used to associate things with each other - so that you can search for them later.  For example, if you added a tag named "leather", you might use that on a Location or Question or Project, etc. so that later, when you were trying to find items having to do with "leather", your search would show the items you tagged that way.  The tags are auto-completed after you use them.  So, if you add "leather", then later in a Question you type "lea" - it will autocomplete to leather.  You may also add a Description to your Project for your own use.

{: .important }
> Tags are currently available for all items, but the search has not been iplemented as of April 15, 2023.  That feature will be added shortly. Sorry for the inconvenience.

After updating any information, you should choose the <span class="inline-butotn">Update</span> button.  If you do not press Update, your changes will not be saved.  

### Project Delete and Archive
This page also allows you to Delete or Archive this Project.  You will be prompted to confirm the deletion.  

There are 2 forms of deletion:  

1) Delete forever - where your project and all of its locations, questions, answers and results are deleted permanently.

2) Archive - where your Project and associated information is marked as Archived and can be viewed by selecting the filter <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-filter"></i></span> icon on the [Projects](#project-details) list page and choosing Archive.  You may unarchive a Project by editing the Project from the Archived view.
