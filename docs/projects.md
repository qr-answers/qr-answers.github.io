The Projects tab is used to create or list your Projects.  This is the starting point for you to create your Projects.  For a good overview of the Project concept, read [this](../index#project-concept---important) from the Introduction.

   <p align="center" class="screen-shot">
   <img class="image-border" alt="Projects tab, add projects" src="../../assets/images/projects_tab.png">
   </p>

The default Project list display shows "Active" Projects.  You may toggle between "Active" and "Archived" Projects be selecting the filter <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-filter"></i></span> icon in the upper right.  See [Project Delete and Archive](#project-delete-and-archive) below.

## Add Project
You may choose the plus sign <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-square-plus"></i></span> Add Project to create a new Project.  After clicking the plus sign, you enter the Project name you would like
to use in the empty text box.  Press tab or return to save the Project name.  

{: .note }
> If for some reason you get a blank line without a text box, <br><img class="image-border" alt="Contest details screen" src="../../assets/images/projects_blankline.png"><br> you may long press on the 'blank' line and a text box will appear, enter your Project name.  <br> <img class="image-border" alt="Contest details screen" src="../../assets/images/proj_longp.png"><br>Alternatively, click on the blank line to go to the details page (shown below) and then click on the edit pencil icon in the upper right to type in the Project name.  This 'disappearing text box' issue may happen occassionally, we are working to fix this for all browsers.

Next, click on the Project name to take you to the details of the Project.  

## Project Details
The default display of the Project Details page is to open the <span class="inline-accordion">Campaigns</span> accordion.  After the basics of adding <span class="inline-accordion">Locations</span>, <span class="inline-accordion">Questions and Answers</span> is complete, most of the work is done in the Campaigns section.  

   <p align="center" class="screen-shot">
   <img class="image-border" alt="Project details screen" src="../../assets/images/project_screen.png">
   </p>

### Edit Project
As you can see above, the Project Details screen has an edit pencil <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i></span> icon in the upper right. Clicking on that will bring up the Edit Project screen.

   <p align="center" class="screen-shot">
   <img class="image-border" alt="Edit project basic attributes" src="../../assets/images/project_attributes.png">
   </p>

#### Tags
You may change the Project Name here.  You may also add an Abbreviation for the Project that will show up in the [Results](./results) overview.  In addition, you may add Tags to your Project.  In general Tags are used to associate things with each other - so that you can search for them later.  For example, if you added a tag named "leather", you might use that on a Location or Question or Project, etc. so that later, when you were trying to find items having to do with "leather", your search would show the items you tagged that way.  The tags are auto-completed after you use them.  So, if you add "leather", then later in a Question you type "lea" - it will autocomplete to leather.  You may also add a Description to your Project for your own use.

{: .important }
> Tags are currently available for all items, but the search has not been iplemented as of April 15, 2023.  That feature will be added shortly. Sorry for the inconvenience.

After updating any information, you should choose the <span class="inline-butotn">Update</span> button.  If you do not press Update, your changes will not be saved.  

### Project Delete and Archive
This page also allows you to Delete or Archive this Project.  You will be prompted to confirm the deletion.  

There are 2 forms of deletion:  

1) Delete forever - where your project and all of its locations, questions, answers and results are deleted permanently.

2) Archive - where your Project and associated information is marked as Archived and can be viewed by selecting the filter <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-filter"></i></span> icon on the [Projects](#project-details) list page and choosing Archive.  You may unarchive a Project by editing the Project from the Archived view.

### Locations
<div class="accordion-bar">Locations</div>
Locations are used to attach questions to a place.  That may seem odd at first blush, but is is useful to organize your questions.  You must add at least 1 Location to each Project.  If you aren't posting Questions in multiple places, just name your default Location "Default".  If you are posting Questions at a conference, you might use the room number as the Location.  If you are a franchise owner or have multiple business locations, you might use the address or name of each business as the Location.  So, Locations are used as a place to post your Questions.  The Location name can be printed on the resulting PDF file so it is easy to place the Question and Answers in the right place.

#### Add Location
You may add a new Location by pressing the plus sign Add button.  That will allow you to enter a Location name in the highlighted text box - see below:

   <p align="center" class="screen-shot">
   <img class="image-border" alt="add a location" src="../../assets/images/add_location.png">
   </p>

After you add your Location(s), you move on to adding Questions and Answers below.

### Questions and Answers
<div class="accordion-bar">Questions and Answers</div>
Now that we have a Location, we can add Questions and Answers.

#### Questions
You may add as many Questions as you like.  Later in the [Campaigns](#campaigns) section, you assign each Question to a Location that you created above.

##### Add Question
Click on the <span class="inline-accordion">Questions and Answers</span> accordion  and press the plus sign <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-square-plus"></i></span> Add Question button to enter a question - like <i>Which setting worked better for you today?</i>

   <p align="center" class="screen-shot">
   <img class="image-border" alt="Add question" src="../../assets/images/add_question.png">
   </p>

##### Delete Question
To delete a Question (and all of its Answers), click on the edit pencil <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i></span> icon and then choose the <span class="inline-button">Delete</span> button.  You will be prompted to make sure that is what you want to do.

   <p align="center" class="screen-shot">
   <img class="image-border" alt="Delete question" src="../../assets/images/delete_question.png">
   </p>

##### Edit Question Details
You may edit the Question details like tags, description, etc. by clicking on the edit pencil <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i></span> icon.  You will see the below screen.  Keep in mind, you can edit the Question text by long pressing on the text in the list.

   <p align="center" class="screen-shot">
   <img class="image-border" alt="Add question" src="../../assets/images/edit_question.png">
   </p>

All Projects, Questions, Answers and Campaigns have Tags and a Description field. See [Tags](#tags) for a complete description.

##### Add Answer
The plus sign Add Answer option will show automatically after you enter your Question.

   <img class="image-border" alt="List of answers" src="../../assets/images/hm_text_answers.png">
   </p>

##### Delete Answer
To delete an Answer, you may press on the trash can <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-trash"></i></span> icon on the right of the Answer, or see the [Edit Answer Details](#edit-answer-details) below.

##### Edit Answer Details
There are several options that you may apply to each Answer.  To edit the Answer details (add photos, add Tags, Description or Link URLs), press on the pencil <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-pencil"></i></span> icon.  You will get an Edit Answer screen like below:

   <p align="center" class="screen-shot">
   <img class="image-border" alt="Edit Answer" src="../../assets/images/edit_answer.png">
   </p>

The default type of Answer for any Question is a <span class="form-label">Text</span> answer. However, you may have <span class="form-label">Text</span> and/or <span class="form-label">Photo</span> answers (you can combine them if you like).  In the above screen shot, you will see that we have both a Text and Photo Answer combination.  Click the checkbox for which one(s) you would like.  When you check the box for Text, you will see the <span class="form-label">Text Answer</span> text box that you may edit.  When you check the <span class="form-label">Photo</span> checkbox, you may then assign a photo in 3 ways:

1) Enter URL - pressing the <span class="inline-button">Enter URL</span> button will display a <span class="form-label">Photo URL</span> text box.  You may type or paste a URL to the photo in that box; after you type or paste the URL, press tab or enter to accept the photo.  You will see the photo show up in the <span class="form-label">Image Preview</span> area.

2) Upload - pressing the <span class="inline-button">Upload</span> button will prompt you with an Upload dialog where you may pick a photo to upload.  Some browser require your permission to access the photos on your phone or desktop, so if you are prompted to allow uploads, choose yes.  Also, some browser have a Preference Setting that may enable or disable photo upload.  If you don't get an upload dialog, check your browser's settings.

3) Take Photo - pressing the <span class="inline-button">Take Photo</span> button will attempt to use the camera on your device to pick a previously recorded photo or take a new one. If you are on a desktop browser, it may act like you pressed Upload if you do not have a camera.

Once a photo shows in the <span class="form-label">Image Preview</span> area, you may rotate the image using the left <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-rotate-left"></i></span> and right <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-rotate-right"></i></span> rotate icons.  Once you press the <span class="inline-button">Update</span> button, you will not be able to rotate the photo again. You'll have to re-upload it.

<div class="accordion-bar-qr">Optional Answer Link</div>
When someone chooses this Answer, there is an optional 'action' that can be implemented.  The <span class="form-label">Link Behavior</span> choice determines what the URL will do.  There are 2 choices:

1) Link - selecting this radio button will add the <span class="form-label">Link Text</span> to the results page (pie chart, etc.) that, when clicked, will go to the <span class="form-label">Link URL</span>.  For example, maybe you would like someone to sign up for your newsletter.  You could make the <span class="form-label">Link Text</span> say "Sign up for our newsletter" and the <span class="form-label">Link URL</span> go to your website newsletter signup form.

   <p align="center" class="screen-shot">
   <img class="image-border" alt="Link text and Link URL" src="../../assets/images/link_text.png">
   </p>

Then, when the results are displayed after the person scans this Answer's QR code, it would show this:

   <p align="center" class="screen-shot">
   <img class="image-border" alt="Link text on results page" src="../../assets/images/link_text_results.jpeg">
   </p>

2) Automatic Redirect - selecting this radio button will disable the <span class="form-label">Link Text</span>.  You may put a URL in the <span class="form-label">Link URL</span>, so that when someone scans an Answer, instead of showing the results page of a pie chart, bar graph, etc. it will record the vote and automatically redirect to the entered <span class="form-label">Link URL</span>.  

For example, your question may be <i>"Which document would you like to download?"</i> and the Answers would be names of documents (like a Tesla Model S, X or Y pamphlet).  When the person scans the Answer <i>"Tesla Model S"</i>, then they would automatically be redirected to the Tesla Model S PDF document online.  The vote for the Answer will still be recorded.

##### Reorder Answers
When you generate a PDF or list of PNG files, the Answers will show up in the order that you have listed them in this list.  To reorder the list, long press on the up/down arrow <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-up-down"></i></span> icon and drag the Answer to a new position.
