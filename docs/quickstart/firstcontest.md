Let's add a second location so we can assign Questions to different Locations.  Add a new Location called Lobby.

The <span class="inline-accordion">Campaign Question Assignments</span> accordion is open by default.  There are many options for your Campaigns in the other accordions that will be covered under the Campaigns section.  For now, we will just assign our Question(s) to a Location so we may print our first draft.

<div class="step-number" style="width: 64px;"><div class="snumber">12</div></div><div class="step-title">
The <span class="inline-accordion">Campaign Question Assignments</span> accordion shows a list of Locations that you created for this Project.  You may assign Question(s) to each Location separately.  Let's assign a Question to <strong>Showroom B</strong> and another Question to <strong>Lobby</strong>.  Skip the download icon on the left and click on the words <strong>Showroom B</strong> or the down arrow <span class="inline-icon-black"><i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i></span> icon.  You will see a list of the available Questions for this Project. Check the box next to <i>Which Setting worked better for you today?</i>.  That will enable this Question at the Showroom B Location.  (Remember, you can assign that Question to multiple locations).

{: .new }
> Any time you check a box next to a question, the global 'clear all' checkbox at the top right of the list will be enabled. This is a shortcut for 'clear all checkboxes for all locations'.

Now, open the second location <strong>Lobby</strong> and check the <i>Which computer did you use?</i> for that Location.

Let's print a test for the <strong>Showroom B</strong> Location.  Click on the download <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-download"></i></span> icon to the left of the Location name.  You will then see the below screen.  Note, you can print all of your questions by using the <span class="inline-accordion">Campaign Bulk Print</span> accordion - we'll do that later.

Just use the defaults for now, so click <span class="inline-button">Make PDF</span>.  You will get a progress screen saying "Generating documents...", then the below screen will appear with a link to your PDF file and a copy <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-copy"></i></span>  icon in case you want to paste the link somewhere else.

<p align="center" class="screen-shot">
<img class="image-border" alt="download resulting PDF file" src="../../../assets/images/download_acme.png">
</p>

Click on the link and you will see the PDF below.  You can test your choices by scanning them with your phone's camera.  Beware, you are only in DRAFT mode, so you will only see the last thing you scanned show up in the results.  Once you move the Campaign to ACTIVE, it will start recording votes properly.

<p align="center" class="screen-shot">
<img class="image-border" alt="showroom B sample PDF" src="../../../assets/images/showroomb_pdf.png">
</p>

If we use the phone and scan the "Desk Cube" answer (center choice in the top row), you will see the below on your phone. Click the link where it shows <span class="phone-link"><span style="font-size: .5em; margin-right: 4px;"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></span>qr-answers.com <span style="color: gray">></span></span> and you will see the results.

<p align="center" class="screen-shot">
<img class="image-border" alt="showroom B sample PDF" src="../../../assets/images/scan_deskcube.png">
</p>

These results then show up on the phone, if you scroll down, it will show you the answer you chose; in this case "Desk Cube".
