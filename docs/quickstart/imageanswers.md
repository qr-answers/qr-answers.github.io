Answers may have Text answers, Image answers or both.  This will show you how to add Images to your answers.

After completing the steps in [First Contest](firstcontest.md), you may add images to your answers so the answers
have more visual appeal.

1. Go to your Contest under the Contest bottom tab.

   <img class="image-border" alt="Contests tab" src="../../assets/images/tab_contests.png">
2. Click on the Contest created in [First Contest](firstcontest.md). 
   For this example, we used *Which chicken do you like better?*

   <img class="image-border" alt="Add answers" src="../../assets/images/chicken_answers.png">
3. For each answer shown there are 3 icons on the line. The up/down arrow <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-regular fa-arrows-v"></i></span> allows you to drag
the order of the answers so they display in that order (long press on them to drag them).  The pencil icon <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-regular fa-pencil"></i></span> allows you to edit the details of
the answer (there are many options).  The trash can icon (not shown) on the far right <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-regular fa-trash"></i></span> allows you to delete that answer (it will ask you to confirm prior to actually deleting it.)

4. Let's add images to each chicken.  Click the pencil icon next to *Lady Feathers*.
   For details of all the options, see the [Edit Answers](../screens/edit_answer.md) page. For now, we'll just add an image.

   Click the <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-regular fa-square-check"></i></span> Photo checkbox. This will add an Image Preview section.  You may enter a URL, Upload an image, or if you are on your phone - Take a Photo.  We'll upload an image.

   <img class="image-border" alt="Upload image" src="../../assets/images/upload_image.png">

   {: .note }
   > After the image is uploaded, you may rotate it by using the rotation buttons.  You will only be able to rotate it when you upload it, not after you save it by pressing Update.

   Scroll down and select the <span class="ineline-button">Update</span> button to save your Image.

5. Repeat the process for each Answer.
   You will end up with something like this:

   <img class="image-border" alt="All chickens" src="../../assets/images/all_images.png">

6. Scroll down to the <span class="inline-accordion">Print/Download</span> accordion and click on it, then scroll down to the <span class="inline-button">Make PDF</span> button (notice the section *4. Fit and Opacity for Photo Answers*, it is set to 'Cover').  Click the <span class="inline-button">Make PDF</span> button, then download and view your PDF.

</p>

7. Click on <span class="inline-accordion">Print/Download</span> again to close then open it.  Scroll down to section *4. Fit and Opacity for Photo Answers* and choose <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i></span> Contain.  Then click <span class="inline-button">Make PDF</span>
